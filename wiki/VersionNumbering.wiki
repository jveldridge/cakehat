#summary Describes the version number system.

=About Releasing=
Make sure to update the information in CakehatReleaseInfo.java!

=Release Types=
There are three type of releases for cakehat:
1. major (#.0.0)
2. minor (#1.#2.0, with #2 not 0)
3. minor-minor (#1.#2.#3, with #3 not 0)

== Major Releases ==
Major releases are *incompatible* with all previous versions of cakehat.  Any of the following may change for a major release:
  * the database structure
  * the .cakehat directory structure
  * valid configuration settings
  * GML structure
  * run and lab checkoff scripts

Major releases are expected to occur only at the beginning of a semester. 

A release branch should be created for all major release branches.  A development branch may also be used.

== Minor Releases ==
Minor releases add new features, enhancements, and non-critical bug fixes.

There could be several minor releases over the course of a semester, depending on the rate of development.  Courses will be encouraged but not required to update to the latest minor release.

A release branch should be created for all minor release branches.

== Minor-Minor Releases ==
Minor-minor releases are used only for critical bug fixes.  They are not to add any new features.

Minor-minor releases can occur at any point.  Since they will be made only for critical bug fixes, all courses will be required to update to the latest minor-minor release.

For the time being, new release branches will not be created for minor-minor releases.  Instead, further critical fixes will be made in the corresponding minor release branch (which should be renamed).
