<!-- 1 top-level "GRADING-SHEET" node
	The top-level node
	Required attributes:
		>GML-VERSION: the GML version in which this grading sheet is written; can be used to
					  determine whether the grading sheet can be parsed by the version of
					  cakehat being used
		>TYPE: type of rubric; currently, the only supported type value is "ADDITIVE", but we
			   may support "SUBTRACTIVE" or others at some point in the future
		
	Optional attributes:
		>STATUS: indicates the grading status of this grading sheet.  Permissible values are:
			>UNSUBMITTED-MODIFIED: score has not been recorded in the database, but the grading
								   sheet has been modified since it was created from the
								   template
			>SUBMITTED-UNMODIFIED: the grading sheet has been submitted and the score recorded
								   in the database at least once since the grading sheet was
								   created, and no changes have been made since the grading
								   was last submitted
			>SUBMITTED-MODIFIED: the grading sheet has been submitted and the score recorded
								 in the database at least once since the grading sheet was
								 created, but the grading sheet has been modified since it was
								 last submitted
				If the "STATUS" attribute is not provided, it is assumed that the grading sheet is
				unsubmitted and has not been modified since it was created.

Talk to Josh about:
TEXT_NODE, COMMENT_NODE

??? Do we want to use any other libraries (dom4j?) for printing and parsing ???

Note that these changes make the grading sheet / directory structure significantly less
human-readable.
